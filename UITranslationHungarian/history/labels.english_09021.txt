Message_Date=Year :
Message_welcome=Welcome to your assigned planet. <br><br>Your mission is to advance the terraformation process of this world. Generate 0², Heat and pressure to do so. <br><br><br>First, reach 175.000 Ti and create a blue atmosphere.
Message_YouAreAConvict=This is an automated message. <br><br>To : Convict GP-8971-L<br><br>You have chosen to commute your sentence into an extradition. In order to be released of all the charges pending against you, you must fully terraform this planet. Our sensors will periodically scan your progress and will send you the required blueprints. <br><br> - Do not try to contact Sentinel Corp. in any case.<br><br> - If our sensors do not detect any advancement on the terraformation process, you will be considered missing, the charges will not be dropped. <br><br> - You can not claim property or value over anything on the planet. <br><br> - You are only allowed to use the resources found on the planet to increase the terraformation index.<br><br> - You are not allowed to leave this planet until the terraformation is complete.
Message_Help1=Hello! <br>I finally managed to locate the system they sent you to. <br><br>I don't have much time, but I'll try to give you some advice. <br>The success rate of 'Planet Crafters' is so low because it's nearly an impossible task:  <br><br>- You should find space food in your pod and maybe in space wrecks.  <br><br>- You'll be able to grow food by yourself when you meet the correct requirements. So try to find some vegetable seeds.   <br><br>- Exploration and improvements are essential. Explore and improve your equipment to increase your chances of survival. <br><br>I hope this message will reach you. <br>
Message_Ship_A_1=Cargo Ship Cirella-IV<br><br>Machinery Log n°436 <br><br><br>This morning, as we were in our 17th day of space travel to Stigmar, the ship inexplicably exited hyperspace velocity. <br>The navigation tools went crazy and all the ship's power went down, as if it was drained by something exterior... <br><br>We are going to try to make an emergency landing on this unreported planet. I'm not sure what we'll find there, the planet seems to have a huge storm on the surface. <br><br>I hope we'll make it...
Message_PlanetIdentification=Your planet specifications <br><br>Identification : unamed<br>Corporation ownership : unclaimed<br>Habitability level : null<br>Sector : Izitial Prime<br>History : unknown<br><br> {unamed} planet is located in the Izitial Prime sector, a pre-civilization sector, crossed mostly by trade ships to travel between big space ports.<br>The sector count 842 planets, 13511 stars, and is 7.000 parsecs wide. <br><br>The planet has been identified as a possible candidate for future colonization.<br>
Message_dunes_cache_1=Our ship has crashed for an unknown reason on this planet. <br><br>Many of us died on impact. Some of us died on the surface. <br><br> I'm the only one left. <br><br>I tried to survive, but this land is too hostile. My health is getting bad... <br><br> I'm going outside one last time to try to find some water...
