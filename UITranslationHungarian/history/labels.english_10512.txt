Message_Date=Year:
Message_welcome=Welcome to your assigned planet. <br><br>Your mission is to advance the terraformation process of this world. You'll need to generate 0², Heat and Pressure. <br><br><br>First, reach 175.000 Ti and create a blue atmosphere.
Message_YouAreAConvict=This is an automated message. <br><br>To: Convict GP-8971-L<br><br>You have chosen to have your sentence commuted to an extradition. To get all the charges against you dropped, you must fully terraform this planet. Our sensors will periodically scan your progress and send you the required blueprints. <br><br> - Do not try to contact Sentinel Corp.<br><br> - If our sensors do not detect any advancement in the terraformation process, you will be considered missing and the charges will not be dropped. <br><br> - You cannot claim ownership or value over anything on the planet. <br><br> - You are only allowed to use the resources found on the planet to increase the terraformation index.<br><br> - You are not allowed to leave the planet until the terraformation is complete.
Message_Help1=Hello! <br>I finally managed to locate the system they sent you to. <br><br>I don't have much time, but I'll try to give you some advice. <br>The success rate for Planet Crafters is very low because it is an almost impossible task: <br><br>- You should find space food in your pod and maybe in space wrecks. <br><br>- You'll be able to grow food when you meet the correct requirements. So, try to find some vegetable seeds. <br><br>- Exploration and improvements are essential. Explore and improve your equipment to increase your chances of survival. <br><br>I hope this message reaches you. <br>
Message_Ship_A_1=Cargo Ship Cirella-IV<br><br>Machinery Log n°436 <br><br><br>This morning, on our 17th day of space travel to Stigmar, the ship inexplicably exited hyperspace velocity. <br>The navigation tools went crazy and the ship lost power, as if it had been drained by some exterior thing... <br><br>We are going to try to make an emergency landing on this unreported planet. I'm not sure what we'll find. There seems to be a huge storm on the surface of this planet. <br><br>I hope we make it...
Message_PlanetIdentification=Your planet specifications <br><br>Identification: unnamed<br>Corporation ownership: unclaimed<br>Habitability level: null<br>Sector: Izitial Prime<br>History: unknown<br><br> Planet {unnamed} is located in the Izitial Prime sector, a pre-civilization sector, crossed mostly by trade ships traveling between big space ports.<br>The sector has 842 planets, 13511 stars, and is 7000 parsecs wide. <br><br>The planet has been identified as a possible candidate for future colonization.<br>
Message_dunes_cache_1=Our ship crashed on this planet for an unknown reason. <br><br>Many of us died upon impact. Some died on the surface. <br><br> I'm the only one left. <br><br>I have tried to survive, but this land is too hostile. My health is deteriorating... <br><br> I'm going outside one last time to try to find some water...

Message_selenea_construction1=Who would have thought we'd be where we are today? We've come a long way since our arrival. It hasn't all been easy, but we've held on and never given up. Our ideals have carried us this far, and I'm proud of what we've achieved. Despite some minor tensions within the group, morale is very high.
Message_selenea_construction2=Construction report: The construction site is progressing well, and we're still on schedule, despite being a little behind schedule due to minor tool issues. This year's cold weather is causing some machines to malfunction, but overall, everything is going well. I can't wait to inaugurate this new dome; it will make our lives even more comfortable. I hope Ari likes the new children's area!
Message_selenea_construction3=I can't wait for this place to be finished. I'll be able to expand my lab and acquire new machines to conduct my experiments and better understand this magnificent planet. My recent work has given me a better understanding of geological formation, and I'm now going to focus more on the relationships between minerals and the planet's balance.
Message_selenea_greenhouse1=Because of the extraction of mineral resources, there are far fewer of us than expected to maintain the greenhouses and harvest crops. Plus, this year's yields are lower. I really hope this mine is worth it, because I'm starting to find field work less and less interesting. I had a hard time imagining how monotonous it would be...
Message_selenea_greenhouse2=Izz, for the third time, could you arrange for us to receive materials to repair the pipes? This is the third one that's burst due to the cold this month! I thought we'd specifically chosen a planet with favorable climatic conditions... Or did Koa make a mistake in their calculations?
Message_selenea_greenhouse3=The first harvests! What a joy to see life growing on our planet. Like a harbinger of our community's rebirth, we'll be able to feed ourselves with our own produce. Most of what I planted has grown, and it even seems that a few species have already adapted to the low light conditions. I'll be able to do plenty of experiments in the future!
Message_selenea_city1=Archives: Pioneer Charter<br><br>Like others before us, we wanted to try something else. Another way to play the game of existence. The rules of the game that were proposed to us no longer suited us. For ourselves and our children, we wanted to review these rules, to free ourselves from them and reinvent new ones. To see where our ideas could lead us, by stopping complaining and taking back control of our destinies through our own actions. Where will that lead us? There's only one way to find out: try.
Message_selenea_city2=Archives: First Year<br><br>It seems like a year has already passed since we arrived. Our long period of preparation has paid off, and our organizational systems have proven their effectiveness. This has allowed us to begin our installation under good conditions. We hadn't planned everything, but overall, everything is going well. To celebrate, we organized a big party in the first dome, which was a real treat for everyone. The work is sometimes exhausting given the size of the task, but our motivation remains strong.
Message_selenea_city3=Archives: Vote on Blazar Quartz Mining.<br><br>37 in favor and 8 abstentions. The discussions were long, but we reached a consensus. The decision was made to launch a major Blazar Quartz mining project alongside our subsistence activities.
Message_selenea_city4=Archives: Blazar Quartz Discovery<br><br>After a thorough analysis of the geological layer, Koa shared an interesting discovery with us. Beneath our feet lies high-quality quartz that could be very useful to us in the future. We decided to form a study group to identify our options in this regard.
Message_selenea_city5=Val, could you ask Izz if it's possible to have a little more heating exceptionally for the next few months? I know everyone needs to be careful, but I'm a little worried about the baby. I saw him shaking a little the other day, and despite all the blankets, I'm afraid it'll leave him with after-effects. Thank you, I love you.
Message_selenea_spacesport2=What a waste... All this effort will have been unrewarded. The gift from heaven wasn't one and will have led to our downfall... I would have liked to stay, but this planet is no longer livable. The recent difficulties have undermined our sense of community. It's unfortunate, I didn't want to leave, but many have already left us; we won't be able to hold on any longer.
Message_selenea_spacesport3=Perhaps one day, our technologies will be advanced enough to warm this big rock, and if our children haven't forgotten this place, perhaps they'll return to continue what we started. But given the difficulty of the last few months, and the bad experience it has been, I doubt it. Everyone seems to want to turn the page on this adventure.
Message_selenea_spacesport4=It's high time to leave. Yes, it could have been a wonderful experience, and we experienced some intensely joyful moments during those years. But you have to learn to resign yourself when the elements are against you. I can't stand this cold anymore, and it's getting worse every day. I can't believe Koa decided to stay, preferring science over humanity...
Message_selenea_spacesport5=The Blazar Quartz trade has allowed us to advance much faster than expected. Today, we celebrate this spaceport, which will allow us to trade even more easily and efficiently. It's even possible that in the years to come, new people will join us to keep our project alive and growing!
Message_selenea_mineBottom1=What a discovery this deposit is! If we had known we would find it on this planet, we would have worried a lot less! It should allow our colony to do really well in the future and help us suffer much less from the precarious conditions of our settlement.
Message_selenea_mineBottom2=Today is a big day, it's the day the main rotors are activated. It took a lot of courage and effort to get here, but it was worth it. I feel like fate is giving us a little nudge to congratulate us on everything we've done to get here!
Message_selenea_mineBottom3=I wasn't the most enthusiastic about the idea of ​​installing giant drills when this project was proposed, but I think I did well to follow the group's consensus. This will open the door to greater comfort, and it should reduce any remaining tensions related to overcrowding. If we're going to trade interplanetarily with what we're going to extract, we'll have to be careful, however; it could attract the attention of unwanted people...
Message_selenea_mineBottom4=Elevator temporarily disabled for safety reasons.
Message_selenea_mineTop1=Operating Notes: Once extracted with the drills, the ore is crushed and transported directly to the large storage vaults on the lower level. This allows for a constant influx of Blazar Quartz. As long as there's room in the vaults, they'll be refilled with ore.
Message_selenea_mineTop2=The properties of Blazar Quartz are exceptional. It seems to interact with its immediate external environment; I'm still struggling to fully understand the chemical mechanism at work. But one thing is certain: this Quartz absorbs and destroys the heat of its surroundings. How did I not see this sooner?! With the quantities we've unearthed, the entire planet is at risk of cooling at breakneck speed...
Message_selenea_mineTop3=Despite all my efforts, I haven't found any way to reverse the process. The rate at which quartz absorbs heat is immense and only increasing. The drop in temperature over the past few years is finally being explained; it was obvious that I failed to identify early enough. How can I ever forgive myself? This planet won't be habitable for much longer; I must warn everyone.
