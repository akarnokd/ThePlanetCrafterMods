Message_Date=Year:
Message_welcome=Welcome to your assigned planet. <br><br>Your mission is to advance the terraformation process of this world. You'll need to generate 0², Heat and Pressure. <br><br><br>First, reach 175.000 Ti and create a blue atmosphere.
Message_YouAreAConvict=This is an automated message. <br><br>To: Convict GP-8971-L<br><br>You have chosen to have your sentence commuted to an extradition. To get all the charges against you dropped, you must fully terraform this planet. Our sensors will periodically scan your progress and send you the required blueprints. <br><br> - Do not try to contact Sentinel Corp.<br><br> - If our sensors do not detect any advancement in the terraformation process, you will be considered missing and the charges will not be dropped. <br><br> - You cannot claim ownership or value over anything on the planet. <br><br> - You are only allowed to use the resources found on the planet to increase the terraformation index.<br><br> - You are not allowed to leave the planet until the terraformation is complete.
Message_Help1=Hello! <br>I finally managed to locate the system they sent you to. <br><br>I don't have much time, but I'll try to give you some advice. <br>The success rate for Planet Crafters is very low because it is an almost impossible task: <br><br>- You should find space food in your pod and maybe in space wrecks. <br><br>- You'll be able to grow food when you meet the correct requirements. So, try to find some vegetable seeds. <br><br>- Exploration and improvements are essential. Explore and improve your equipment to increase your chances of survival. <br><br>I hope this message reaches you. <br>
Message_Ship_A_1=Cargo Ship Cirella-IV<br><br>Machinery Log n°436 <br><br><br>This morning, on our 17th day of space travel to Stigmar, the ship inexplicably exited hyperspace velocity. <br>The navigation tools went crazy and the ship lost power, as if it had been drained by some exterior thing... <br><br>We are going to try to make an emergency landing on this unreported planet. I'm not sure what we'll find. There seems to be a huge storm on the surface of this planet. <br><br>I hope we make it...
Message_PlanetIdentification=Your planet specifications <br><br>Identification: unnamed<br>Corporation ownership: unclaimed<br>Habitability level: null<br>Sector: Izitial Prime<br>History: unknown<br><br> Planet {unnamed} is located in the Izitial Prime sector, a pre-civilization sector, crossed mostly by trade ships traveling between big space ports.<br>The sector has 842 planets, 13511 stars, and is 7000 parsecs wide. <br><br>The planet has been identified as a possible candidate for future colonization.<br>
Message_dunes_cache_1=Our ship crashed on this planet for an unknown reason. <br><br>Many of us died upon impact. Some died on the surface. <br><br> I'm the only one left. <br><br>I have tried to survive, but this land is too hostile. My health is deteriorating... <br><br> I'm going outside one last time to try to find some water...

Message_selenea_construction1=Who would have thought we'd be where we are today? We've come a long way since our arrival. It hasn't all been easy, but we've held on and never given up. Our ideals have carried us this far, and I'm proud of what we've achieved. Despite some minor tensions within the group, morale is very high.
Message_selenea_construction2=Construction report: The construction site is progressing well, and we're still on schedule, despite being a little late due to minor tool issues. This year's cold weather is causing some machines to malfunction, but overall, everything is going well. I can't wait to inaugurate this new dome; it will make our lives even more comfortable. I hope Ari likes the new children's area!
Message_selenea_construction3=I can't wait for this place to be finished. I'll be able to expand my lab and acquire new machines to conduct my experiments and better understand this magnificent planet. My recent work has given me a better understanding of geological formation, and I'm now going to focus more on the relationships between minerals and the planet's balance.
Message_selenea_greenhouse1=Because of the extraction of mineral resources, there are far fewer of us than expected to maintain the greenhouses and harvest crops. Plus, this year's yields are lower. I really hope this mine is worth it, because I'm starting to find field work less and less interesting. I had a hard time imagining how monotonous it would be...
Message_selenea_greenhouse2=Izz, for the third time, could you arrange for us to receive materials to repair the pipes? This is the third one that's burst due to the cold this month! I thought we'd specifically chosen a planet with favorable climatic conditions... Or did Koa make a mistake in their calculations?
Message_selenea_greenhouse3=The first harvests! What a joy to see life growing on our planet. Like a harbinger of our community's rebirth, we'll be able to feed ourselves with our own produce. Most of what I planted has grown, and it even seems that a few species have already adapted to the low light conditions. I'll be able to do plenty of experiments in the future!
Message_selenea_city1=Archives: Pioneer Charter<br><br>Like others before us, we wanted to try something else. Another way to play the game of existence. The rules of the game that were proposed to us no longer suited us. For ourselves and our children, we wanted to review these rules, to free ourselves from them and reinvent new ones. To see where our ideas could lead us, by stopping complaining and taking back control of our destinies through our own actions. Where will that lead us? There's only one way to find out: try.
Message_selenea_city2=Archives: First Year<br><br>It seems like a year has already passed since we arrived. Our long period of preparation has paid off, and our organizational systems have proven their effectiveness. This has allowed us to begin our installation under good conditions. We hadn't planned everything, but overall, everything is going well. To celebrate, we organized a big party in the first dome, which was a real treat for everyone. The work is sometimes exhausting given the size of the task, but our motivation remains strong.
Message_selenea_city3=Archives: Vote on Blazar Quartz Mining.<br><br>37 in favor and 8 abstentions. The discussions were long, but we reached a consensus. The decision was made to launch a major Blazar Quartz mining project alongside our subsistence activities.
Message_selenea_city4=Archives: Blazar Quartz Discovery<br><br>After a thorough analysis of the geological layer, Koa shared an interesting discovery with us. Beneath our feet lies high-quality quartz that could be very useful to us in the future. We decided to form a study group to identify our options in this regard.
Message_selenea_city5=Val, could you ask Izz if it's possible to have a little more heating exceptionally for the next few months? I know everyone needs to be careful, but I'm a little worried about the baby. I saw him shaking a little the other day, and despite all the blankets, I'm afraid it'll leave him with after-effects. Thank you, I love you.
Message_selenea_spacesport2=What a waste... All this effort will have been unrewarded. The gift from heaven wasn't one and will have led to our downfall... I would have liked to stay, but this planet is no longer livable. The recent difficulties have undermined our sense of community. It's unfortunate, I didn't want to leave, but many have already left us; we won't be able to hold on any longer.
Message_selenea_spacesport3=Perhaps one day, our technologies will be advanced enough to warm this big rock, and if our children haven't forgotten this place, perhaps they'll return to continue what we started. But given the difficulty of the last few months, and the bad experience it has been, I doubt it. Everyone seems to want to turn the page on this adventure.
Message_selenea_spacesport4=It's high time to leave. Yes, it could have been a wonderful experience, and we experienced some intensely joyful moments during those years. But you have to learn to resign yourself when the elements are against you. I can't stand this cold anymore, and it's getting worse every day. I can't believe Koa decided to stay, preferring science over humanity...
Message_selenea_spacesport5=The Blazar Quartz trade has allowed us to advance much faster than expected. Today, we celebrate this spaceport, which will allow us to trade even more easily and efficiently. It's even possible that in the years to come, new people will join us to keep our project alive and growing!
Message_selenea_mineBottom1=What a discovery this deposit is! If we had known we would find it on this planet, we would have worried a lot less! It should allow our colony to do really well in the future and help us suffer much less from the precarious conditions of our settlement.
Message_selenea_mineBottom2=Today is a big day, it's the day the main rotors are activated. It took a lot of courage and effort to get here, but it was worth it. I feel like fate is giving us a little nudge to congratulate us on everything we've done to get here!
Message_selenea_mineBottom3=I wasn't the most enthusiastic about the idea of ​​installing giant drills when this project was proposed, but I think I did well to follow the group's consensus. This will open the door to greater comfort, and it should reduce any remaining tensions related to overcrowding. If we're going to trade interplanetarily with what we're going to extract, we'll have to be careful, however; it could attract the attention of unwanted people...
Message_selenea_mineBottom4=Elevator temporarily disabled for safety reasons.
Message_selenea_mineTop1=Operating Notes: Once extracted with the drills, the ore is crushed and transported directly to the large storage vaults on the lower level. This allows for a constant influx of Blazar Quartz. As long as there's room in the vaults, they'll be refilled with ore.
Message_selenea_mineTop2=The properties of Blazar Quartz are exceptional. It seems to interact with its immediate external environment; I'm still struggling to fully understand the chemical mechanism at work. But one thing is certain: this Quartz absorbs and destroys the heat of its surroundings. How did I not see this sooner?! With the quantities we've unearthed, the entire planet is at risk of cooling at breakneck speed...
Message_selenea_mineTop3=Despite all my efforts, I haven't found any way to reverse the process. The rate at which quartz absorbs heat is immense and only increasing. The drop in temperature over the past few years is finally being explained; it was obvious that I failed to identify early enough. How can I ever forgive myself? This planet won't be habitable for much longer; I must warn everyone.
Message_selenea_lastone1=The cold intensifies, everything around me is frozen, the blazar continues to absorb all the heat from this planet. I secretly hoped to find a way to reverse the process, but nothing works.
Message_selenea_lastone2=I'm too cold, it's the end. Selenea, I loved you with all my heart. Our project was the one I've dreamed of my whole life. If this project can't survive, I don't want to live either. I would die with it. On this planet that gave me everything before taking it all away. I'm leaving for my last stroll on this beautiful moon...

Message_toxicity_officierQuarters2=Incident report: During tungsten drilling operations, a highly toxic emission was detected at the central extraction drill following the perforation of a toxic tunnel. The fault was sealed to prevent contamination. No negative impact on equipment was reported. Nothing else of significance to report.
Message_toxicity_officierQuarters3=We wish you a great arrival on your new planet. You'll find here all the necessary to realize your tasks as you were instructed to. This place can be hostile, but if you follow instructions, you won't encounter any danger. Feel free to get comfortable for a few days before heading off to your duties.
Message_toxicity_rebelAlliance=Here, far from scrutiny, they'd love to make us forget our humanity, our hopes and destinies. Whatever happened in the past, we are still humans, we should be allowed to dream at night. We won't live like scared animals forever. If you think the same, if you yearn for something else, for more, for a future, join us. You'll find us under the rocky trees. Like rats, we live in the sewers, search there…
Message_toxicity_rebelAlliance_enter=To join us, you'll need to show some sense—we don't need idiots, and those dim-witted guards will never find the object to place in this terminal to open this door: <br><br> In a wax palace with golden cells,<br>I sleep, lulled by the buzzing of winged fairies. <br>I cannot fly yet, but one day I will,<br>When I leave my bed to become a sun gatherer.
Message_toxicity_rebels_cave1=Everyday we grow stronger. They found the message and believed in it, so they found us. Only the bravest and smartests join our ranks, and we'll soon be enough to stand upon our oppressors. All these humiliations will soon be judged. For our fallen friends, for the future, for our families, we must rise and fight!
Message_toxicity_rebels_cave2=We've managed to steal goods from the transport trains, which allows us to support ourselves for a bit more. Life underground isn't easy, and the security situation is putting a lot of pressure on us. But when I see Ryudyn act, giving it all in everything he does, it gives me so much hope. Soon we will be enough and we'll have enough weapons to carry out an attack that will deal a fatal blow to our jailers.
Message_toxicity_rebels_cave3=Brothers, sisters, the assault is almost ready; we will attack at nightfall. With the element of surprise, believe me, we will bring down these torturers and free ourselves from our chains. Once that is done, we will take control of the planet and restore our autonomy. After that, we'll be able to expand and convince others to rebel, join forces and bring change in the whole universe!
Message_toxicity_prison_mutation1=There are clearly not enough of us to look after all these prisoners! And the guards aren't going to help us! Here, the pollution is starting to affect people's bodies, and some of the sick are beginning to hallucinate badly. Some talk about returning to their roots and being freed by the mother fungus. The other day, I saw two of them climb over the fence and head toward the fault line like zombies. No one will go looking for them anyway, it's far too toxic now, but what will become of them?
Message_toxicity_prison_controlRoom1=Prisoner's release note: Prisoner Milikeï has been granted exceptional permission to leave the prison, with no possibility of return. The orders were to escort him to the extraction zone at the top of the dam. It appears that Sentinel Corp has offered him the opportunity to participate in an experimental program related to the research laboratory's activities. I'm not going to complain about that—let them do what they want with him!
Message_toxicity_prison_controlRoom2=Incident report: Last night, at dusk, 31 people besieged the prison with poor-quality weapons. It seems that some prisoners escaped and organized a small rebellion. It was quickly suppressed, which gave the troops a chance to train a little, which did them good. A few attackers managed to escape and fled like rats. Six of our soldiers were slightly injured, but nothing serious.
Message_toxicity_prison_milikei=Die here or die elsewhere. Given the choice, I prefer to die on my own terms. They told me my chances would be slim, but that I could help open a new path for the future of humanity and my fellow beings. In any case, I can't stand this planet anymore. The more time passes, the more polluted and repulsive it becomes. After all, isn't creating life the most beautiful thing I could do? Wouldn't that be the most beautiful way to redeem myself?
Message_toxicity_prison_notes1=How is it that humanity, despite all its advances, has still not found a better way to deal with its most harmful elements? Like a toxic spore, I have contaminated my fellow humans. But can't we purify a toxin? Or kill the source of the rot directly at its origin? Is the only solution really to gather all the toxins together to form a putrid mass and make them suffer to punish them for their rot? Couldn't we detoxify the cause directly and finally live in a purified world? But I imagine that seriously asking this question is of no interest to anyone, so let's just live in a toxic world...
Message_toxicity_prison_notes2=Don't be sad, mother. This is my destiny and I accept it. All the actions of my life have led me here, and I take responsibility for them. This place is harsh, cruel, unfair, and dirty, but I suppose it's a bit like me after all. I just miss the clean air. I can't stand this rancid smell that's everywhere, outside, in my cell, on my clothes, and even deep in my sheets. I hate this putrid smell.
Message_toxicity_prison_notes3=Tomorrow I'm changing cells following yesterday's incidents. I'm being transferred to the cell next door, and everyone knows what happened to the guy before me. I'm not cut out for this place, I don't have the weapons. I'm not strong enough, nor am I smart enough. I have no contacts and no allies. I'm alone and I'm terrified.
Message_toxicity_prison_notes4=I have lost the ability to influence my own destiny. Other people have complete power over my life. Are we really individuals if all our choices are made by others? Do we still have dignity when our name is replaced by a number? I am nothing more than a puppet, watching a game being played out against me.
Message_toxicity_prison_wardens1=We place our destiny in your hands, almighty engravers. We place our destiny in your hands, almighty engravers. We place our destiny in your hands, almighty engravers. We place our destiny in your hands, almighty engravers. We place our destiny in your hands, almighty engravers. We place our destiny in your hands, almighty engravers.
Message_toxicity_research_center_Isolation=They all making me nervous. I see both sides as equally bad. I'm glad our research center is here, isolated from them all. I'm glad I chose to work on this program, but I would have preferred to work elsewhere. Even though I understand now why they decided to make us work here.
Message_toxicity_research_center_briefing=Planet Crafter Briefing: Your mission is to conduct advanced scientific research in order to develop a range of technologies that will enable the terraforming of entire planets by isolated individuals sent independently to these planets. These technologies must be unlocked in a specific order based on the progress made by the colonists in order to ensure their chances of success without unnecessary expense. Although this mission will be very complex to accomplish, you will find everything you need on this planet, both in terms of equipment and human assistance.
Message_toxicity_research_center_no_trust=Are we sure we can trust Sentinel Corp with this kind of research? I'm glad they're funding us, but I find it hard to believe their true motives. Who would want to go to a desert planet and try to terraform it? All alone, no less? Their brief seems more interested in the economic aspect than in the well-being of these famous “colonists”... I'm not even sure we'll be able to develop the technology needed to terraform an entire planet anyway.
Message_toxicity_research_center_start_of_tests=Sentinel Corp asked us this morning to begin testing to send a first potential candidate. After conducting a few interviews, we selected a candidate. I'm not going to lie to you, it looks like a suicide mission. I'm confident in our calculations and technology, but there are so many parameters to take into account...
Message_toxicity_research_center_legal_release="Legal Release: I hereby consent to participate in the ""Planet Crafter"" program as the first colonist. I certify that I will do everything necessary to terraform the planet on which I land using the technologies at my disposal and the resources available there. I understand that the conditions of my current sentence have been modified accordingly."
Message_toxicity_miningPit_top1=I saw them. After the toxic fumes burned my skin, the guards immediately sealed off one of the entrances to the bottom of the mine. I know there were other people still inside; at least ten were behind me. The guards didn't hesitate for a second to sacrifice them, like squashing a bothersome insect... I heard them scream behind me before everything collapsed... Would I have done the same in their place? Sacrificed a few to avoid a worse fate? I haven't slept for days; I hear their screams when I close my eyes...
Message_toxicity_miningPit_top2=Audio log: Come on, you lazybones, it's time to get moving! The resources of this planet aren't going to extract themselves! It's not my fault you're here, you only have yourselves to blame, so don't expect any pity from me! Get a move on if you want to eat tonight! And don't bother whining, nobody can hear you in this corner of the universe.
Message_toxicity_miningPitDrain=Since this planet has no natural water cycle, we shouldn't have any problems with infiltration, as so often happens. To be on the safe side, we have nevertheless installed a filtration system. All we need to do is place a few purification fuses to drain the crevice and its cavities if there is ever a problem.
Message_toxicity_whiteCarry_wardens=This planet holds unsuspected secrets. Others came here before us. We cannot decipher all their writings, but it is clear that superior beings lived here long before us. Perhaps they are still alive, close to us? Perhaps they are observing us, wondering about our fate and our living conditions. Can we hope that they will come to save us, poor doomed souls? Will they be able to raise our level of humanity to theirs? I want to believe. I need to hope. We all need hope here if we are to endure. We need to believe...
Message_toxicity_sporetower1=After 16 years on this planet, this extraction operation no longer has any purpose. Most of the valuable resources have been extracted from the planet, which therefore no longer has any value in its current state. As expected, the planet is no longer habitable due to the consequences of extraction, so we can begin the process of evacuating the condemned. People and infrastructure that can be moved should be sent to the planet Jiron-5 to start the process over from scratch. The rest can stay.
Message_toxicity_sporetower2=If the sensor readings are correct, our first candidate did not survive. He made no significant progress in terraforming his planet. I find it hard to believe that this program will ever have a success rate exceeding 10%, despite all our efforts and research. Perhaps future scientific advances will help us aid these poor souls. Sent to a hell they will only discover once they arrive, with the hope of succeeding where all others have failed. Is hope, ultimately, always truly our ally? Why is this concept so highly valued, when it makes us so oblivious to pragmatic realities? Three new candidates have already volunteered...
Message_toxicity_swamps1=We had believed in it, though. I was convinced that we were going to deal them a fatal blow. We were determined and sure of the righteousness of our cause! Wasn't that enough?! Despite their obvious inferiority, the firepower and defenses at their disposal made short work of our hopes. Ryudyn was among the first to fall. I saw the flame in his eyes die out in a matter of seconds. That same flame that had convinced us all to follow him, to live underground for months, and to fight. Is it better to die like a man or live like a dog? I don't have long to live anyway, but perhaps it would have been better to live...
Message_toxicity_dam_wardens=It is said that they will come to save us, these superior beings who understand our faults and imperfections. Capable of correcting what makes us slaves to our own biases. Of saving those who err, and calming those who seek to punish. We await their arrival, praying that they will free us from our self-imposed tyrannies. We place our destiny in your hands, almighty engravers.
Message_toxicity_dam_rooftop=Financial analysis: After 15 years of operation, the planet's valuable resources are largely depleted. So far, all planets acquired by Sentinel Corp have been profitable investments. But the results are not as good as before. In order to preserve the company's profits, we recommend that Sentinel Corp explore other sources of revenue for the planets it owns. In the future, the new Planet Crafter program could be a significant new source of revenue for the company, as a terraformed planet is far more valuable than a hostile one in the long run.
